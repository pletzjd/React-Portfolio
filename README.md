At the bottom of the page, highlighted in yellow in the above image, are icons for github, linkedIn and stack overflow which when clicked link to my personal profile for each of those respective sites.

The above image shows the "About Me" section of the the website. In this section there is a profile picture of myself along with brief description about myself.

Below is the section for the portfolio of my work. There are a total of six projects displayed on this page. Each image links to the deployed application. The button labeled 'Repo' links to the repo of the application.

Below is the section to contact me. It contains a form that can be filled out to send me a message (not functional at the moment). If a field is left blanc when focus is lost or the email address inputed does not look like a valid email address an error message displays below the form to alert the user. When the submit button is clicked and all the fields are properly filled in an alert message pops up to inform the user that a message has been sent.
